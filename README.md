# Linktree

Linktree is a personal project that serves as a centralized hub for all my important links, social media profiles, projects, and more. It provides an easy and convenient way for visitors to access my various online platforms and explore my work.

Additionally, with the customizable HTML file, users can easily create their own Linktree by changing the text and adding their own links.

## Features
- **Social Media Links**: Find direct links to my profiles on popular social media platforms including Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub, Spotify, and LeetCode.
- **Project Showcase**: Discover and explore my various projects through organized links. Each project provides a brief description and a link to access more details.
- **Personalized Profile**: My profile picture is prominently displayed to create a personalized touch and enhance the visual appeal of the Linktree.
- **Hover Effects**: Enjoy engaging and cool hover effects applied to both the profile picture and the project buttons, providing an interactive experience for visitors.
